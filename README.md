# MC_Dislocations
-Modelled system energy decrease in a dislocation cell lattice using a Monte Carlo algorithm in Python
-Extended algorithm to ilustrate radial pair distribution occuring within atomic dislocations
-Accelerated scientific analysis by using Numba

This is one of the projects I worked on as an Undergraduate Research Assistant in Professor Asta's Research Group. I worked with PhD student Anas Abu-Odeh to explore innovations in computational materials science, focusing on atomistic simulations and modelling of dislocations of alloys.
