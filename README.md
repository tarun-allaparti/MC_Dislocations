# MCdislocations-radialpair
-Created a program with Python to model the Monte Carlo algorithm for dislocation cells to prove that randomization within the cells ultimately result in a decrease in energy over time
-Using iteration and functions, developed an extension to the Monte carlo algorithm that illustrates the radial pair distribution within dislocations in an atom
-Utilized Numba, a Python module to accelerate the scientific analysis of the atomistic code
